    question: "What is steel corrosion on ship hulls?",
    answer: (
      <>
        Steel corrosion on ship hulls is the process of degradation or damage to the steel used in ship structures due to chemical or electrochemical reactions with the marine environment. This includes seawater, oxygen, and high humidity, which lead to the formation of rust and a gradual reduction in the material‚Äôs strength.

        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-2">
          <li><b>Marine environment:</b> Seawater contains high levels of salt, especially sodium chloride (NaCl), making it a good conductor of electricity.</li>
          <li><b>Chemical reaction:</b> When steel is exposed to seawater and oxygen, a chemical reaction occurs that slowly ‚Äúeats away‚Äù the metal and forms rust.</li>
          <li><b>Environmental factors:</b> Temperature differences, humidity, and pressure variations accelerate corrosion.</li>
          <li><b>Protective coating damage:</b> Scratches or damage to paint make steel more vulnerable.</li>
          <li><b>Galvanic corrosion:</b> When two different metals are placed close together, one corrodes faster.</li>

        <li><b>Uniform corrosion:</b> Rust spreads evenly across the steel surface.</li>
        <li><b>Pitting corrosion:</b> Creates small but deep holes, often not visible externally.</li>

    answer: (
      <>
        <p className="mb-2">
          The corrosion mechanism of steel hulls is similar to rust formation on iron but more aggressive due to the marine environment. It involves electrochemical reactions where steel (iron alloy) interacts with seawater.
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
          <li>Parts of the steel surface act as an anode and others as a cathode.</li>
          <li>At the anode, iron atoms lose electrons and become iron ions (Fe¬≤‚Å∫).</li>
          <li>Electrons flow to the cathode, react with oxygen and water to form hydroxide ions (OH‚Åª).</li>
          <li>These ions combine to form hydrated iron oxide (Fe‚ÇÇO‚ÇÉ¬∑xH‚ÇÇO), known as rust.</li>
          <li>Seawater accelerates this process due to its electrolytic nature.</li>

          <li>Corrosion sensors to measure moisture, temperature, pH, and conductivity.</li>
